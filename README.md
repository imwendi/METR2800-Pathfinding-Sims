# METR2800-Pathfinding-Sims

Robot navigation sim environment for the METR2800 team project course, used to evaluate navigation algorithms and generate plots for assessment pieces.

The robot must navigate to the center of a square map from an unknown initial position. Its only spatial awareness is provided by proximity sensors facing directly the 'forwards' and 'backwards' directions.

Classes have been implemented to represent the map and different pathfinding algos as subclasses of `Bot`.
